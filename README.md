# ST3189 Machine Learning Coursework Project

## Overview
The project implements three machine learning methodologies—**Unsupervised Learning**, **Regression**, and **Classification**—on real-world datasets sourced from Kaggle. The report details the analysis process, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and result interpretation, while contrasting findings with existing literature where applicable.

- **Report**: 10 pages (excluding cover page, table of contents, and bibliography)
- **Code Language**: [Python (Jupyter Notebook)]
- 
The project is divided into three main tasks, each applied to a distinct dataset:
1. **Unsupervised Learning**: Customer segmentation using PCA and K-means clustering on a credit card dataset.
2. **Regression**: Predicting medical insurance costs using multiple regression models.
3. **Classification**: Sentiment analysis of financial reviews using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

### Datasets
The datasets used in this project are publicly available on Kaggle. Links to each dataset are provided below and referenced in the bibliography of the report:
- **Credit Card Dataset**: [Credit Card Dataset for Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata/data)
